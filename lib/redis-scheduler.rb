## A basic chronological scheduler for Redis.
##
## Use #schedule! to add an item to be processed at an arbitrary point in time.
## The item will be converted to a string and later returned to you as such.
##
## Use #each to iterate over those items in the schedule which are ready for
## processing. In blocking mode, this call will never terminate. In nonblocking
## mode, this call will terminate when there are no items ready for processing.
##
## Use #items to iterate over all items in the queue, for debugging purposes.
##
## == Ensuring reliable behavior in the presence of segfaults
##
## The scheduler maintains a "processing set" of items currently being
## processed. If a process dies (i.e. not as a result of a Ruby exception, but
## as the result of a segfault), the item will remain in this set but will
## not longer appear in the schedule. To avoid losing scheduled work due to
## segfaults, you must periodically iterate through this set and recover
## any items that have been abandoned, using #processing_set_items. Setting a
## proper 'descriptor' argument in #each is suggested.

  ## Options:
  ## * +namespace+: prefix for Redis keys, e.g. "scheduler/"
  ## * +blocking+: whether #each should block or return immediately if there are items to be processed immediately.
  ##
  ## Note that nonblocking mode may still actually block momentarily as part of
  ## the check-and-set semantics, i.e. block during contention from multiple
  ## clients. "Nonblocking" refers to whether the scheduler should wait until
  ## events in the schedule are ready, or only return those items that are
  ## ready currently.
  def initialize redis, opts={}
    @redis = redis

  ## Schedule an item at a specific time. item will be converted to a string.
  def schedule! item, time
    id = @redis.incr @counter
    @redis.zadd @queue, time.to_f, "#{id}:#{item}"
  end

  ## Drop all data and reset the schedule entirely.
  def reset!
    [@queue, @processing_set, @counter].each { |k| @redis.del k }
  end

  ## Return the total number of items in the schedule.
  def size; @redis.zcard @queue end

  ## Returns the total number of items currently being processed.
  def processing_set_size; @redis.scard @processing_set end

  ## Yields items along with their scheduled times. only returns items on or
  ## after their scheduled times. items are returned as strings. if @blocking is
  ## false, will stop once there are no more items that can be processed
  ## immediately; if it's true, will wait until items become available (and
  ## never terminate).
  ##
  ## +Descriptor+ is an optional string that will be associated with this item
  ## while in the processing set. This is useful for providing whatever
  ## information you need to determine whether the item needs to be recovered
  ## when iterating through the processing set.

  ## Returns an Enumerable of [item, scheduled time] pairs, which can be used
  ## to iterate over all the items in the queue, in order of earliest- to

  ## Note that this view is not synchronized with write operations, and thus
  ## may be inconsistent (e.g. return duplicates, miss items, etc) if changes
  ## to the schedule happen while iterating.
  ##
  ## For these reasons, this is mainly useful for debugging purposes.

  ## Returns an Array of [item, timestamp, descriptor] tuples representing the
  ## set of in-process items. The timestamp corresponds to the time at which
  ## the item was removed from the schedule for processing.

  ## underlying the schedule is not parseable. This should basically never
  ## happen, unless you are naughty and are adding/removing items from that
  ## zset yourself.

  ## Supports random access with #[], with the same caveats as above.
